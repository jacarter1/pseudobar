To do this, I first created a class called SingleMingle, which takes in various instance attributes (name, age, friend, school, and drink) in order to create the optimal flirting experience. The class has multiple attributes that guide a user through a simulated conversation with a single male who is ready to mingle."

    "#### This is my first time coding, and I was initially overwhelmed at the prospect of creating my own final project of this magnitude. With that being said, I am certain that there are students in our course who created far more complex projects that utilized a wider range of previously unexplored packages and methods! However, I tried my best on this project and am very proud of my work. I coded my own chatbot from scratch, which is something that we have not previously done in this course, hence urging me to challenge myself. I ensured that my functions passed all tests with my assert statements, and created as many test functions as I could think of. I also combined a wide array of Python tools learned in the past 10 weeks (datetime objects, importing packages such as datetime and random, creating classes and methods, etc.). Lastly, I genuinely had fun with this project, successfully turning it into a fun experience for both code creators (myself) and users alike."
